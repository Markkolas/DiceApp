# DiceApp
Shitty application made by Marco Antonio Villa aka "El Yoyis".

TO DO list:
	Add usability (queues of throws, probabilities calculator, mixed throws in one result, etc)
	Change the design and implementation of the UI, its so bad it makes me sad
	Make it prettier
	Make it better in general

Special thanks to Diego Dominguez for making me do the piece of garbage this program is (to be fair I only used
3 days making it).

This program can be used and modified by anyone.

Kisses.
